# Football Match Analysis with Football Data API  

This project utilizes the **Football Data API** to analyze match results from a selected competition. The key objectives are:  

- Identifying the best teams at **holding a lead at home** (winning at halftime and full-time).  
- Determining the top teams at **making comebacks in the second half**, regardless of home or away status.  
- Calculating both the **absolute count** and **percentage** of these occurrences for each team.  
- Constructing the **league table** based on wins (3 pts), draws (1 pt), and losses (0 pts).  
- Analyzing the correlation between top-performing teams and their ability to hold or overturn results.  

This project provides insights into team resilience and consistency based on real match data.

# Analysis of the Relationship Between League Position and the Ability to Hold Leads at Home
There is a general correlation between a team's league position and its ability to hold leads at home, but it is not an absolute relationship.

Top-ranking teams such as Sporting CP, Benfica, FC Porto, and Santa Clara have a high percentage of secured matches, suggesting that higher-ranked teams are more consistent in maintaining their advantage when leading at halftime.

However, there are exceptions, such as CD Nacional and CF Estrela da Amadora, which, despite having a high percentage of secured games, do not occupy the top positions in the standings. This may indicate that while they successfully hold leads, they might have fewer matches where they were actually ahead in the first place.

A surprising underperformance in this metric comes from Sporting de Braga, Casa Pia, and Vit√≥ria SC, which, despite being relatively well-ranked in the league, show significantly lower-than-expected values in their ability to hold leads at home. This underperformance may suggest that these teams struggle to control games after taking the lead, contrasting with their overall league position.

On the other hand, teams at the bottom of the table, such as AVS and SC Farense, have some of the lowest percentages of secured matches, which could reflect difficulties in maintaining positive results at home.

Thus, while there is a tendency for stronger teams to be more effective at holding leads, this factor alone is not the sole determinant of their success in the standings.

# Analysis of Teams That Managed to Turn Around Matches in the Second Half After Trailing at Halftime
So far in the league, only a few teams have been able to come back from a halftime deficit and secure a victory by the end of the match. This highlights the difficulty of overturning a losing position, emphasizing the importance of having an early advantage in football.

However, some teams stand out in this metric, with Sporting de Braga being the most effective at making comebacks, successfully overturning halftime deficits in around 33% of cases. Sporting CP and Casa Pia AC also demonstrate notable performances in this statistic, showcasing a strong ability to respond after a poor start.

Other teams, such as CD Santa Clara, Moreirense FC, and CF Estrela da Amadora, have also managed to turn matches around, albeit less frequently. CF Estrela da Amadora, despite being in a lower league position, appears among the teams that have managed comebacks, indicating a fighting spirit even if their overall results are not as strong.

On the other hand, most teams in the league do not appear in this list, reinforcing the fact that overturning a halftime deficit is a rare and challenging feat. The teams that manage to do so demonstrate not only strong mentality

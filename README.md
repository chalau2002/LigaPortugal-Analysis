# Football Match Analysis with Football Data API  

This project utilizes the **Football Data API** to analyze match results from a selected competition. The key objectives are:  

- Identifying the best teams at **holding a lead at home** (winning at halftime and full-time).  
- Determining the top teams at **making comebacks in the second half**, regardless of home or away status.  
- Calculating both the **absolute count** and **percentage** of these occurrences for each team.  
- Constructing the **league table** based on wins (3 pts), draws (1 pt), and losses (0 pts).  
- Analyzing the correlation between top-performing teams and their ability to hold or overturn results.  

This project provides insights into team resilience and consistency based on real match data.
